# Interview-Assignment

This project demonstrates automating the booking of movie tickets on the Cineplex website using OpenAI's language models (via LangChain) and Selenium for web automation. This project focuses on automating the movie ticket booking process.

## Objective

Create an automated system to handle the entire movie ticket booking process up to the payment stage using LangChain and Selenium, reducing manual effort and time required for such tasks.

## Approach

We use LangChain to interface with OpenAI's language models and Selenium for web interaction. This allows us to handle websites that do not have public API endpoints.

## Explanation of the Code

The provided code automates the process of booking movie tickets on the Cineplex website:

1. **Import Modules**: Handles natural language processing and web automation.
2. **API Key Setup**: Authenticates with OpenAI's language models.
3. **Initialize WebDriver**: Sets up Selenium WebDriver for Chrome.
4. **Initialize Chat Model**: Creates an instance of the chat model.
5. **Create Prompt Template**: Defines system and human messages for booking tickets.
6. **Initialize Output Parser**: Parses the output from the chat model.
7. **Chain Components**: Combines the chat prompt, chat model, and output parser.
8. **Generate Response**: Uses the chain to generate a response based on input parameters.
9. **Web Automation**: Uses Selenium to perform actions based on the generated response.

## Why This Approach

1. **Combining NLP with Web Automation**: Leverages NLP to understand and generate responses, which are used for web automation.
2. **Modular Design**: Separates tasks into distinct steps, enhancing readability and maintainability.
3. **Flexibility**: Adaptable to various websites and tasks beyond movie ticket booking.

## Tips for Improvement

1. **Error Handling**: Implement try-except blocks for robust error handling.
2. **Enhanced Parsing**: Improve output parser for complex responses.
3. **Logging and Debugging**: Implement logging for tracking steps and issues.
4. **Testing**: Develop unit tests for each function.

## Alternative Solutions

1. **Headless Browsers**: Use headless browsers for background automation.
2. **APIs and Direct Integrations**: Use official APIs where available like rabbit
